      <!-- This line is kind of confusing. Basically '<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>' is embedded php in this html '$_PHP_SELF' is a variable that repersents this file. You could theoretically have this be an html file and instead of "<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>" have the path to a different php file. After this form is excuted the php above is going to be executed. You don't need to memorize this just have a basic understanding of what is going on  -->

         Age: <input type = "text" name = "age" />
         <input type = "submit" /> <!-- creates submit button that submits all the information in the form -->
